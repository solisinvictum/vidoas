# vidoas
vidoas - safely edit the doas.conf file (like visudo for doas)

Updated/forked Version compared to original one: https://git.sr.ht/~insidepie/vidoas/tree
This Version is specific to Arch and his opendoas package (location /etc/doas.conf)
Changed the behavior of this Script to be exactly like visudo, wich NEEDS the user to be root.

Thanks to original Author Joshua Murphy for his initial work https://git.sr.ht/~insidepie/vidoas
